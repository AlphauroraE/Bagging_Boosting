# Bagging_Boosting

This repository contains my code for the Bagging and Boosting assignment in my Algorithms for Machine Learning class.

Bagging is explored via the [Random Forest](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestRegressor.html) model in sklearn.

Boosting is observed by utilizing [AdaBoost](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.AdaBoostRegressor.html), also in sklearn.
